\title{ Mixture M5 Data }
\description{ 
A bivariate data set obtained from three normal bivariate distributions with different scales and proportions 1:2:2. One of the components is very overlapped with another one. A 10\% background noise is added uniformly distributed in a rectangle containg the three normal components and not very overlapped with the three mixture components. A precise description of the M5 data set can be found in García-Escudero et al. (2007).
